# KRAUTS 
*A German Temporally Annotated News Corpus*

KRAUTS (Korpus of newspapeR Articles with Underlinded Temporal expressionS) is a German temporally annotated news corpus accompanied with TimeML annotation guidelines for German. It was developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy and at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany. Our goal is to boost temporal tagging research [1] for German. 

The corpus is available under [CC-BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) and is described in:
* Jannik Strötgen, Anne-Lyse Minard, Lukas Lange, Manuela Speranza, Bernardo Magnini:  
   **KRAUTS: A German Temporally Annotated News Corpus**, LREC'18 (to appear)

KRAUTS contains articles from the daily newspaper *Dolimiten* and from the weekly newspaper *Die Zeit*.

The annotation guidelines are strongly based on the guidelines defined for Italian, i.e., the It-TimeML guidelines [2].
Our Annex to the It-TimeML guidelines contains (annotated) examples in German and extensions needed to adapt the It-TimeML guidelines to the specific morpho-syntactic features of German. It is available on the [It-TimeML website](https://sites.google.com/site/ittimeml/documents).

A publicly available temporal tagger for German is HeidelTime, which can be found on the [HeidelTime github page](https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime/).
